File Converter
==============

Converts files from CSV to JSON formats and vice-versa. 

This is meant to be used as the final project for the Python course from the Artificial Intelligence program at PUC Minas.

It has nothing groundbreaking, so you can safely ignore it. In any case, if you managed to get here, feel free to check my other (hopefully) more useful projects:

- `Python TSP <https://github.com/fillipe-gsm/python-tsp>`_: a TSP solver;
- `Python Kanban <https://github.com/fillipe-gsm/python-kanban>`_: a Kanban board for the command line.
